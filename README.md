# SecurityCommands

Instead of an username and password combination as security personalized commands would be used.

1. This would include a personal command to login in the beginning. Another password command would be required so there would be a combo of
credentials. Login command: HGTYVBS Password Command:Cricket
2. Everything that takes place in the application would require commands. View, Edit, Send
3. View photos for example could be HTW(Random) Photos. Edit information would be EDINF Information and so on.
4. A table of commands could be not saved by anybody but yourself or that table, for a little less security, could be saved by an organization.
5. For anything that requires heavy security this would be worthwhile and if there are enough time using the application then they would be quickly
learned anyway.
